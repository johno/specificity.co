      <p>
        When CSS doesn't do what you think it should, one of your first likely culprits is specificity.
        However, the notion of specificity shouldn't be a source of frustration. It provides a set of
        rules that you can count on when constructing your style sheets. There needs to be a system to
        determine which style property to use when there are conflicts, and specificity values do just
        that.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How is specificity determined?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every selector has a specificity value. Whichever value is larger dictates which styles are applied.
        When the specificity value is the same between multiple rules, the rule that is defined last is
        the rule that is applied. When it comes to specificity, as a whole, the last rule defined determines
        the styling to be applied whenever there is a conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general rule, it's best to spend time thinking about how to structure your styling in a more
        modular fashion. Leveraging
        <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/">OOCSS principles</a>
        or a <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">preprocessor</a> would be a great place to start. This allows
        you to approach styling in a consistent, predicitable way. You should apply styling to an HTML
        document so specificity isn't even a consideration.
      </p>
      <p class="italic mid-gray">
        Web browsers use specificity like a hierarchy to determine which style properties to apply. This is
        how the styling of a document "cascades".
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to make sense of what CSS selectors to prioritize, selectors are placed in four categories:

        <ol class="h3 px1 dark-gray">
          <li>Inline styles</li>
          <li>IDs</li>
          <li>Classes and Attributes</li>
          <li>Elements</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="mb3 h2 mid-gray italic">What do these categories even mean?</p>
      <h3>
        Inline styling
      </h3>
      <p>Just don't use this. Ever... Seriously. The same goes for <code>!important</code>.</p>
      <h3>
        IDs
      </h3>
      <p>
        ID selectors have a <em>very</em> high specificity value. This becomes especially problematic when you
        consider the fact that only one ID can be applied to an HTML element. So, similarly to inline styling,
        refrain from leveraging IDs for styling except under the most dire circumstances. IDs are best used
        for javascript DOM queries, anyway.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes
      </h3>
      <p>
        Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes are the bread and butter of properly implemented OOCSS that
        makes specificity a mere hiccup during development. A class selector will <em>always</em> have a
        higher specificity value than an element selector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classes are perfect for implementing styling that isn't the default. For example, if you want to make
        a link look like a button or give a paragraph a different line-height.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Elements and pseudo-elements
      </h3>
      <p>
        This category is the lowest in the specificity value hierarchy. These selectors are typically used for
        a webpage's baseline styling.
      </p>
      <h3 class="h2">There are <span class="italic">always</span> exceptions...</h2>
      <p>
        Embedded styles within a document are considered closer to an element. So they will override Also, the universal selector, <code>*</code> has a specificity of 0.
